## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- A valid Credit Agricole Centre Loire bank account
- Chrome/Chromium browser (installed automatically with Puppeteer)

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:
   ```
   ACCOUNT_NUMBER=your_account_number
   PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

## Usage

Run the automation script:

```bash
npm start
```

Or directly with Node.js:

```bash
node index.js
```

### Categorizing Downloaded Operations

After downloading your CSV file, you can analyze and categorize your operations:

```bash
npm run categorize path/to/your/operations.csv
```

Or directly:

```bash
node categorize-operations.js path/to/your/operations.csv
```

This will:
- Parse the CSV file (expects headers at row 11: Date, Libell√©, D√©bit euros, Cr√©dit euros)
- Categorize operations based on keywords in the Libell√© field
- Generate a detailed financial report
- Save results as JSON and text files

### Visualizing Your Data with Interactive Dashboard

Launch the web dashboard to see your financial data with beautiful charts and graphs:

```bash
node server.js
```

Then open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. Upload the JSON file generated by the categorization tool to see:

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Notes:**

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Your credentials are stored locally and not transmitted anywhere except to Credit Agricole
- The script runs with a visible browser window for transparency
- Consider using this tool only on trusted, personal devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Browser doesn't open:**
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions to run Chrome
- Check if Puppeteer installed correctly: `npm list puppeteer`

**Login fails:**
- Verify your account number and password in `.env`
- Check if Credit Agricole has changed their website structure
- Ensure your account is not locked or requires additional verification

**Download doesn't start:**
- The script waits for page elements to load; slow connections may need longer delays
- Check if you have sufficient account permissions for downloading operations

**Date selection fails:**
- The script selects the current month by default
- Ensure the calendar widget is accessible and not blocked by other elements

### Debugging

The script includes comprehensive logging. Check the console output for detailed information about each step. Log levels include:
- `info`: General operation progress
- `error`: Critical failures (if any)

## Limitations
